# Medical Incident Transcriber

This was My NSS Back-End capstone project. This is App allows first responders to record audio
during an incident and have the audio transcribed in real time with a timestamp so the First Responder or Medic can look back through the transcription for incident details for thier report. This App gives the ability to know when certain event transpired I.E When patient contact was made, when CPR was started or stopped, or when drugs were administered.
